                <h2>INTRODUCTION TO WORLD WAR II</h2>
                <p>World War II or the Second World War[b] was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast
                    majority of the world's countries, including all the great powers, fought as part of two opposing
                    military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participating countries invested all available
                    economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities into this total war, blurring the distinction
                    between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic
                    bombing of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. It was
                    by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70â€“85 million fatalities. Millions died due
                    to genocides, including the Holocaust, as well as starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of
                    Axis defeat, Germany, Austria, and Japan were occupied, and war crime tribunals were conducted
                    against German and Japanese leaders.

                <h3>History of World War II</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland and
                        the United Kingdom and France's declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September
                        1939.</li>
                    <li>Dates for the beginning of the Pacific War include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on
                        7 July 1937, or the earlier Japanese invasion of Manchuria, on 19 September 1931.</li>
                    <li>Others follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who stated that the Sino-Japanese War and
                        war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II in
                        1941.</li>
                    <li>Other theorized starting dates for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3
                        October 1935.</li>
                    <li>The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of
                        Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to
                        September 1939.</li>
                    <li>Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start or prelude to World War II.</li>
